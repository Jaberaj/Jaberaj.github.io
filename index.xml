      <description>Patient advocacy and cultural awareness are integral parts of medical training. Physicians are the caretakers of patients, and I strongly believe they should be their strongest advocates. Oftentimes physicians are criticized for not listening to their patients, being apathetic, and magisterial. Time after time, I hear these criticisms from friends and family about their terrible experiences with physicians, leaving them belittled rather than reassured. As a physician, I aspire to improve patient-physician interactions and advocate for a patient focused practice.</description>
