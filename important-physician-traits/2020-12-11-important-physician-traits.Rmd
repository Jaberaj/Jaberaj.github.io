Patient advocacy and cultural awareness are integral parts of medical training. Physicians are the caretakers of patients, and I strongly believe they should be their strongest advocates. Oftentimes physicians are criticized for not listening to their patients, being apathetic, and magisterial. Time after time, I hear these criticisms from friends and family about their terrible experiences with physicians, leaving them belittled rather than reassured. As a physician, I aspire to improve patient-physician interactions and advocate for a patient focused practice. 

In order to be a patient advocate, a physician must be able to understand the perspective, culture, and beliefs of their patient. A culturally aware physician is the best suited to treat patients, and will best understand what advocacy is needed. 

Integration of cultural awareness and patient advocacy with medical education should be mandatory; taking an active role in developing skills in both is incumbent upon every doctor in training. I strongly believe that these are the key ingredients for successful patient care.
